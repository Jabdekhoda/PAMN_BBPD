## PAMN BBPD

Welcome to the PAMN BBPD repository on GitHub! This repository contains a library for the PAM4 implementation of the idea at the schematic level.

## About the Project

The PAMN BBPD is based on the idea of using all transitions of the PAM signaling scheme to improve the performance of the Bang Bang Phase Detector (BBPD) in clock and data recovery systems(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10396104).  
The repository includes a library that implements the PAM4 signaling scheme, as well as state and simulation test benches to validate the library's functionality.
